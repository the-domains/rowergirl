Welcome to RowerGirl

"What would you like to say to your husband?" A reporter interviewed Australia's Kim Brennan after her incredible, gold medal finish in the women's 1x. She responded with a comment about how her pursuit for rowing excellence had been "selfish" to her husband and family. 

Maybe it was. But would a male athlete have been asked that question? Would a male athlete have apologized for his quest for gold? Recently, I've been hearing a lot about how the women athletes are perceived differently from their male counterparts, with a focus on their relationships or fashions as opposed to their hard work and accomplishments. 

Let's not have a pity party, and let's not pick apart every word the media prints. This subjection of women athletes to sexism is not a new problem, and has slowly molded the way that women's sports are viewed. Because of its presence over time, the sexism can be overlooked as the norm or an innocent question. It is presented subconsciously, almost as a reflex, because this has become the standard for women's sports. 

The reporter meant no harm, and neither did Brennan. She is one of the greatest rowers of all time, graciously accepting her medal and selflessly noting her support system. However, we should notice this double standard. 

So what do we do? This is not something that can change overnight, but we can start to close the gap. We can stand together and support each other, because we can't afford to tear each other down when others have already taken on that responsibility. 

Let's create a community, where we recognize that we are women but don't let it define our success. We use it as a tool to help each other -- which workouts make us fastest? Which food provides the best fuel? Which music motivates us to push our limits? Which clothes allow us the best mobility? 

By working together to become the best rowers possible, we can help each other to get on that podium. The more strong women who get up there, the more we empower each other and ourselves, the more the norms can shift. Let's hear the reporter ask, "what would you like to say to your fellow RowerGirls?"
